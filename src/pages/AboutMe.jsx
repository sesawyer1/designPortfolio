                Hi, I'm Sarah. <br/> <br/>

                As someone who enjoys finding new areas in which I can <br/>challenge myself, I am studying Computer Science, <br/>
                Economics, and Human-Centered Design at Northwestern <br/>University. I will be continuing my education in the fall <br/>
                at Columbia University with a Masterâ€™s of Science<br/> in Financial Engineering. <br/> <br/>

                My interest in the intersection of technology and <br/>creativity has been bolstered by my work with the SONIC<br/> Research Group. 
                As a Data Science Intern, I have<br/> researched the impacts of different authors and genres<br/> on the future success of a patent. 
                Working in an<br/> unfamiliar setting, such as patent data, has allowed me<br/> to work on breaking down challenges into manageable<br/> 
                problems to identify my pain points or areas in which I<br/> can improve upon the project. <br/><br/>
                
                Outside of school and work, you can find me<br/> outdoors! Living in Colorado has instilled a love<br/> of hiking, skiing, and cycling in 
                me. If you are<br/> interested in working with me or learning more<br/> about my background, please reach out! I am happy<br/> to 
                connect over an oat milk latte. <br/><br/>

                </p>
